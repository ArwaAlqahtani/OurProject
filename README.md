# OurProject

## Description 
* The goal is to learn important software engineering skills and activities
* This project aims to develop a web-based machine learning system for a given text classification.
Text classification is a good way to classify text into categories, in addition using machine learning to automate these tasks makes the process much faster and more efficient.



## Installation
* The following steps show you how to set up the node is the server to run the machine learning platform
 (Text Classification Quick Text Tool) on the example from the user.  In order to run the first version of the system, you need the following steps:
1. Download npm:
>  sudo apt install npm
2. Create and open project folder:
> mkdir [your choice name]
3. Initialize requirements:
> npm init -y 
4. Add index.html,index.js and train.txt in the same folder.
5. Install the Node.js sandbox for the Machine learning algorithm (fasttext):
> npm install node fasttext --save
6. Install Express:
> npm install express --save
7. Install some cors issues:
> npm install cors --save
8. Run index.js:
> node index.js
